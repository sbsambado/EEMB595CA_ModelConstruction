```
Assumptions (to name a few)
1. Molting rates are constant for each life stage
2. Mortality rates are constant for each life stage 
2. Competent levels are broken into 3 categories
3. That larvae and nymphs feed at  different rte on each competent level
4. Ticks are always present, no phenology driving presence
5. No host community logistic growth, host community is always constant
